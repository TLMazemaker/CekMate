Excecutive Summary/Abstract: 

Eye health should be one of the priorities that need to be considered since childhood because it can cause permanent damage. One of the eye disorders that must be considered is Leukocoria. Leukocoria in infants is always a danger signal because it can be a symptom of dangerous eye diseases, such as retinoblastoma. Sometimes parents don't realize this symptom and don't immediately check further for a diagnosis of Leukocoria.

Leukocoria results from light reflecting from lesions in the retina when the fundus is illuminated. So Leukocoria can be detected with flash photography. To tackle this, we have an idea to create an android application that uses the flash camera on a smartphone and takes a picture of the eye to be processed and provides results whether there is Leukocoria in the user's eye. The application is made as easy as possible for parents to use to check their children's eyes and provide the best solution if Leukocoria is detected. We also plan to have a health partner who can be contacted directly in dealing with the symptoms of Leukocoria before being diagnosed with a more dangerous disease. This app also provides general knowledge about Leukocoria that can help educate users.
